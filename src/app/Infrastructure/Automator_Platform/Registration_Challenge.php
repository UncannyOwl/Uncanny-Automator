/**
 * C1 requester-bound registration proof (site identity spec, ClickUp
 * 868jw791t).
 *
 * A first registration cannot prove possession of a signing secret (there is
 * none yet), and a site whose secret was lost or no longer matches the
 * platform's cannot either. Instead the plugin generates a random attempt
 * secret, sends it once over TLS in every register request (wire contract W1),
 * and — when the platform answers 202 for a first registration or a recovery —
 * proves it controls the callback host by signing a challenge the platform
 * issues to this site's dedicated pre-registration endpoint. Two
 * domain-separated messages are signed so a challenge-endpoint signature can
 * never be replayed as a completion proof:
 *
 *   - challenge:  `uap-register-challenge-v1:{attempt_id}:{challenge}`
 *   - completion: `uap-register-complete-v1:{attempt_id}:{completion_nonce}`
 *
 * Both are HMAC-SHA256 over the base64-DECODED attempt secret producing lowercase
 * hex — the SAME encoding the platform's RegistrationChallengeService uses (and
 * the same base64-secret / raw-key convention as Hmac_Validator), so the two
 * sides compute byte-for-byte identical output.
 *
 * The attempt (id + secret) is held in the durable options table with its OWN
 * expiry: the challenge endpoint reads it to sign, and the completion poll reads
 * it to redeem the winning signing secret. NOT a transient — on a host with a
 * persistent object cache a transient lives only in that cache, and a flush
 * (routine during a plugin update) would destroy the sole credential that can
 * re-poll /complete, orphaning a site the platform has already committed.
 *
 * The record also paces the completion poll ({@see poll_due()} /
 * {@see record_poll()}): the poll runs on `init`, so without a ladder every
 * request would pay a blocking platform round trip while an attempt is pending.
 *
 * And it says whether the attempt was begun by a move ({@see is_move()}), and
 * whether that move carries no secret ({@see is_move_without_secret()}, move
 * contract §10): the platform keeps the first intention it stored for an
 * attempt id, so what the attempt is for has to live as long as the attempt,
 * and no longer.
 *
