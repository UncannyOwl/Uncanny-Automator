Uncanny Automator is the easiest and most powerful way to connect your WordPress plugins, sites and apps together with powerful automations. Build automated workflows in minutes with no code!

== Description ==

Uncanny Automator is the easiest and most powerful way to automate your WordPress site with no code. Build automations in minutes that connect your WordPress plugins, sites and external apps together using billions of recipe combinations.

Here's how Uncanny Automator works:

When one thing happens, Automator can make other things happen.

When a user buys a product, add them to a membership level, enroll them in a course and pass their information to Google Sheets.

It's that simple! Here's a video outlining how it all works.

If you've used Zapier or Integromat before, setting things up will be intuitive. And if not, that's okay too!

= Free doesn't mean limited =

Over 100 automation triggers and actions are available for the plugins listed above in the free version. There's simple documentation to follow in our [Knowledge Base](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=free_integrations_list), including some quick and straightforward instructional videos. Developers, there's robust documentation and code samples for you too!

Beyond the plugin and API-based integrations, this free version of Uncanny Automator also supports common WP triggers and actions in automations:

- A user views a page
- A user submits a comment
- A user logs in
- A user publishes a post
- Send an email
- Create a post
- Add a WP role

All plugin triggers and actions included in Uncanny Automator come with a forever free license, which allows unlimited usage on your WordPress site. By creating a free, optional Automator account, you can unlock [1,000 credits](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/what-are-credits) to try out premium non-WordPress integrations. You can use credits on your site to:

- Post new content to Facebook Groups, Facebook Pages, Twitter and Instagram
- Pass records to Google Sheets (to generate charts or reports or manipulate data outside of WordPress)
- Notify staff of key events in Slack
- Register customers in Zoom events on product purchase
- Send Mailchimp campaigns when new blog posts are published
- Tag contacts in ActiveCampaign based on their WP activity
- and more

Uncanny Automator does all of this with a single plugin; there's no need to invite conflicts and performance issues with lots of extra integration plugins!

= Take automation to the next level =

[Uncanny Automator Pro](https://automatorplugin.com/pricing/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=take_automation_next_level), our premium plugin, adds even more features and integrations, including the ability to create users and posts, delay and schedule actions, connect multiple sites together, add conditions to actions, and unlock unlimited use of non-WordPress integrations like Google Sheets and Twitter. It also almost triples the number of available triggers and actions.

Here are some of the other really cool automations you can create with [Automator Pro](https://automatorplugin.com/pricing/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=create_really_cool_automations):

- When a user makes a purchase using WooCommerce on one site, create a user on another WP site, send the user a link to set a new password, enroll the user in a course and add a membership level.
- When a user submits a form, add the user to a mailing list if their email address matches a certain domain, add them to a social group and schedule their trial access to expire in 7 days if they don't make a purchase.
- When a new course is published, send an email campaign, post to Twitter and Facebook, post to the BuddyBoss sitewide activity stream and notify instructors in a Slack channel.

And here are some of the key features in the Pro version that allow incredibly flexible and powerful automations for WP:

- Run recipes for logged out users with [Everyone recipes](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/anonymous-recipes/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=pro_recipe_example); you can even create and update existing users.
- Have 2 WordPress sites talk to each other. [Sell products on one WP site](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/send-data-to-a-webhook/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=pro_recipe_example) while [Uncanny Automator creates users](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/webhook-triggers/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=pro_recipe_example) and sets up access on another!
- Have external apps [trigger recipes](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/webhook-triggers/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=pro_recipe_example) and vice versa.
- Set up [buttons and links](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/magic-button/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=pro_recipe_example) that can trigger any recipe on click.
- Set custom user and post meta.
- [Delay or Schedule an action](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/scheduled-actions/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=pro_recipe_example)
- [Filter actions](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/action-filters-conditions/) so they only run when conditions are met, like a matching user email domain or WordPress role.
- [Run any WordPress hook](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/run-a-wordpress-hook/) or [call custom functions](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/call-a-custom-function-method/) in your recipes.
- Automatic [log pruning](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/using-automator-logs/#cleaning-up-the-logs) to keep log size down.

An [Automator Pro](https://automatorplugin.com/pricing/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=pro_support) license also includes access to our world-class premium support.
