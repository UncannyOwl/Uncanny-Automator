Uncanny Automator is the easiest and most powerful way to connect your WordPress plugins, sites and apps together with powerful automations. Build automated workflows in minutes with no code!

== Description ==

Uncanny Automator is the easiest and most powerful way to automate your WordPress site with no code. Build automations in minutes that connect your WordPress plugins, sites and non-WordPress apps together using billions of recipe combinations.

Here's how Uncanny Automator works:

When something happens, Automator can make other things happen.

When a user buys a product, add them to a membership level, enroll them in a course and pass their information to Google Sheets.

It's that simple! Here's a video outlining how it all works.

If you've used Zapier, setting things up will be intuitive. And if not, that's okay too!

= E-commerce Automation =

Improve customer engagement by having your purchases trigger marketing automation campaigns, award store credit, promote 5-star reviews, schedule time-limited bonus offers and offer profile-driven discounts. Or for advanced reporting and customer service, create WooCommerce automations that send purchase details to Google Sheets, Slack and ActiveCampaign. It’s all automatic and you can build these recipes in minutes!

= Google Sheets Automation =

Build powerful reports and dashboards based on almost any WordPress activity or data with 1-click Google Sheets integration. Track purchases, course completions, blog post updates, forum posts and more. Not only can you create new rows for reports with Uncanny Automator, but you can update existing records, making it perfect for dashboard reporting.

= Webhook Automation =

Looking for the most powerful and comprehensive webhook support to connect your WordPress site to other apps? Uncanny Automator has support for security headers, any request method and any data format (including nesting support, JSON, XML, arrays and more). Use our 1-click sample generation and debug records to simplify connecting to other sites and systems, and send unlimited outgoing webhooks with the free version.

= LearnDash and E-Learning Automation =

Personalize student experiences and deliver better learning outcomes with no-code automations. Notify an instructor when users fail a quiz and enroll them in a remedial course–automatically. Add users to groups based on performance to allow easy collaboration. Automate student outreach when users fall behind in their coursework and offer easy learning interventions.

= Social Media Automation =

Spend less time sharing your posts and announcements on social media with automatic posting. Automatically post anything you want to Facebook Pages, Facebook Groups, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram, including with images and links. Sign up for a free account to get 1,000 credits for social posting; Pro plugin users get unlimited posting.

= BuddyBoss Automation =

Put your social community on autopilot with simple Automator recipes that promote sharing and collaboration. Sync groups with membership levels, share key accomplishments in your activity feeds, move users between groups as they progress in LearnDash courses.

= Free doesn't mean limited =

The free version of Automator is incredibly powerful and comes with built-in automation support for all of these popular apps and WordPress plugins:

Over 300 automation triggers and actions are available for the plugins listed above in the free version. There's straightforward documentation in our [Knowledge Base](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=free_integrations_list), including some quick and straightforward instructional videos. Developers, there's robust documentation and code samples for you too!

Beyond the plugin and API-based integrations, this free version of Uncanny Automator also supports common WP triggers and actions in automations:

- A user views a page
- A user submits a comment
- A user logs in
- A user publishes a post
- Send an email
- Create a post
- Add a WP role

All plugin triggers and actions included in Uncanny Automator come with a forever free license, which allows unlimited usage on your WordPress site. By creating a free, optional Automator account, you can unlock [1,000 credits](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/what-are-credits) to try out premium non-WordPress integrations. You can use credits on your site to:

- Post new content to Facebook Groups, Facebook Pages, Twitter and Instagram
- Pass records to Google Sheets (to generate charts or reports or manipulate data outside of WordPress)
- Notify staff of key events in Slack
- Register customers in Zoom events on product purchase
- Send Mailchimp campaigns when new blog posts are published
- Tag contacts in ActiveCampaign based on their WP activity
- and more

= Take automation to the next level =

[Uncanny Automator Pro](https://automatorplugin.com/pricing/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=take_automation_next_level), our premium plugin, adds even more features and integrations, including the ability to create users and posts, delay and schedule actions, connect multiple sites together, add conditions to actions, and unlock unlimited use of non-WordPress integrations like Google Sheets and Twitter. It also triples the number of available triggers and actions.

Here are some of the other really cool automations you can create with [Automator Pro](https://automatorplugin.com/pricing/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=create_really_cool_automations):

- When a user makes a purchase using WooCommerce on one site, create a user on another WP site, send the user a link to set a new password, enroll the user in a course and add a membership level.
- When a user submits a form, add the user to a mailing list if their email address matches a certain domain, add them to a social group and schedule their trial access to expire in 7 days if they don't make a purchase.
- When a new course is published, send an email campaign, post to Twitter and Facebook, post to the BuddyBoss sitewide activity stream and notify instructors in a Slack channel.

And here are some of the key features in the Pro version that allow incredibly flexible and powerful automations for WP:

- Run recipes for logged out users with [Everyone recipes](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/anonymous-recipes/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=pro_recipe_example); you can even create and update existing users.
- Have 2 WordPress sites talk to each other. [Sell products on one WP site](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/send-data-to-a-webhook/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=pro_recipe_example) while [Uncanny Automator creates users](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/webhook-triggers/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=pro_recipe_example) and sets up access on another!
- Have external apps [trigger recipes](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/webhook-triggers/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=pro_recipe_example) and vice versa.
- Set up [buttons and links](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/magic-button/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=pro_recipe_example) that can trigger any recipe on click.
- Set custom user and post meta.
- [Delay or Schedule an action](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/scheduled-actions/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=pro_recipe_example)
- [Filter actions](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/action-filters-conditions/) so they only run when conditions are met, like a matching user email domain or WordPress role.
- [Run any WordPress hook](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/run-a-wordpress-hook/) or [call custom functions](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/call-a-custom-function-method/) in your recipes.
- Automatic [log pruning](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/using-automator-logs/#cleaning-up-the-logs) to keep log size down.

An [Automator Pro](https://automatorplugin.com/pricing/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=pro_support) license also includes access to our world-class premium support.
