Uncanny Automator connects your WordPress plugins and sites together automatically. Build recipes in minutes with no code or extra plugins!

== Description ==

Uncanny Automator is the easiest way to connect things on your WordPress site together. Widely used and trusted on elearning, membership and ecommerce sites since 2018, Automator is free for the first time to everyone!

Here's how Uncanny Automator works:

When one thing happens, Automator can make other things happen.

When a user buys a product, add them to a membership level and enroll them in a course. A user passes a pre-test, autocomplete the rest of the course.

It's that simple! Here's a video outlining how it all works.

If you've used Zapier, setting things up will be intuitive. And if not, that's okay too!

= Free doesn't mean limited =

Developers, there's robust documentation and code samples for you too!

Beyond the plugin integrations, this free version of Uncanny Automator also supports common WP triggers and actions:

- User views a page
- User submits a comment
- User views a post (including custom post types)
- User logs in
- Send an email
- Add a role
- Change a role

Uncanny Automator does all of this with a single plugin; there's no need to invite conflicts and performance issues with lots of extra integration plugins!

= Take automation to the next level =

[Uncanny Automator Pro](https://automatorplugin.com/pricing/), our premium plugin, adds even more features and integrations, including the ability to create new users and posts, connect two separate WordPress sites together and connect your site to non-WordPress applications via webhooks.

Besides more than tripling the number of available triggers and actions for your recipes compared to the free version, Automator Pro for WP adds support for [H5P](https://automatorplugin.com/integration/h5p/) triggers.

Here are some of the other really cool things you can do with [Automator Pro](https://automatorplugin.com/pricing/):

- Integrate with [Google Sheets](https://automatorplugin.com/integration/google-sheets/). Add a row to a Google Sheet when a user makes a purchase, fills out a form, completes a course---the possibilities are endless! Say goodbye to per-transaction fees with Zapier.
- Integrate with [Zoom Meetings](https://automatorplugin.com/integration/zoom-meetings/), [Zoom Webinars](https://automatorplugin.com/integration/zoom-webinars/), [GoToTraining](https://automatorplugin.com/integration/gototraining/), [GoToWebinar](https://automatorplugin.com/integration/gotowebinar/) to automatically enroll users in web conferencing sessions when they complete a recipe
- Integrate with [Twilio](https://automatorplugin.com/integration/twilio/) to send users SMS messages when they complete a recipe
- [Trigger recipes anonymously](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/anonymous-recipes/); fire automations without users needing to sign in. This also means you can turn any form (including forms from free form plugins like Ninja Forms, Contact Form 7, WP Forms, Formidable Forms and more) into registration forms that not only create a new user, but also set them up with course access, group access and more
- Have 2 WordPress sites talk to each other. [Sell products on one site](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/send-data-to-a-webhook/) while [Uncanny Automator creates users](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/webhook-triggers/) and sets up access on another!
- Have external apps [trigger recipes](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/webhook-triggers/) and vice versa (without needing Zapier or Integromat!)
- Set up [buttons](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/magic-button/) that can trigger any recipe on click
- Set custom usermeta

An [Automator Pro](https://automatorplugin.com/pricing/) license also includes access to our world-class premium support.
