Uncanny Automator is the easiest and most powerful way to connect your WordPress plugins, sites and apps together with powerful automations. Build automated workflows in minutes with no code!

== Description ==

Uncanny Automator is the easiest and most powerful way to automate your WordPress site with no code. Build automations in minutes that connect your WordPress plugins, sites and external apps together using billions of recipe combinations.

Here's how Uncanny Automator works:

When one thing happens, Automator can make other things happen.

When a user buys a product, add them to a membership level,enroll them in a course and pass their information to Google Sheets.

It's that simple! Here's a video outlining how it all works.

If you've used Zapier or Integromat before, setting things up will be intuitive. And if not, that's okay too!

= Free doesn't mean limited =

Over 100 automation triggers and actions are available for the plugins listed above in the free version. There's simple documentation to follow in our [Knowledge Base](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/), including some quick and straightforward instructional videos. Developers, there's robust documentation and code samples for you too!

Beyond the plugin integrations, this free version of Uncanny Automator also supports common WP triggers and actions in automations:

- User views a page
- User submits a comment
- User views a post (including custom post types)
- User logs in
- Send an email
- Add a role
- Change a role

Uncanny Automator does all of this with a single plugin; there's no need to invite conflicts and performance issues with lots of extra integration plugins!

= Take automation to the next level =

[Uncanny Automator Pro](https://automatorplugin.com/pricing/), our premium plugin, adds even more features and integrations, including the ability to create new users and posts, connect multiple sites together and even connect sites to non-WordPress apps (via webhooks or native integrations for tools like Google Sheets and Mailchimp, all with no per-transaction costs or delays).

Besides more than tripling the number of available triggers and actions for your recipes compared to the free version, Automator Pro for WP adds support for external apps like Slack, Google Sheets, Mailchimp, Twilio and more.

Here are some of the other really cool automations you can create with [Automator Pro](https://automatorplugin.com/pricing/):

- Integrate with [Google Sheets](https://automatorplugin.com/integration/google-sheets/). Add a row to a Google Sheet when a user makes a purchase, fills out a form, completes a course---the possibilities are endless! Say goodbye to per-transaction fees with Zapier.
- Integrate with [Slack](https://automatorplugin.com/integration/slack/). Integrate your WordPress site directly with Slack and get Slack notifications and direct messages when users make a purchase, cancel a subscription, or any other combination of triggers from any supported plugin.
- Integrate with [Mailchimp](https://automatorplugin.com/integration/mailchimp/). Add users to your Mailchimp audiences, add or remove tags and even send campaigns. Want to send new blog posts to your list automatically? Automator makes it simple.
- Integrate with [Zoom Meetings](https://automatorplugin.com/integration/zoom-meetings/), [Zoom Webinars](https://automatorplugin.com/integration/zoom-webinars/), [GoToTraining](https://automatorplugin.com/integration/gototraining/), [GoToWebinar](https://automatorplugin.com/integration/gotowebinar/) to automatically enroll users in web conferencing sessions when they complete a recipe
- Integrate with [Twilio](https://automatorplugin.com/integration/twilio/) to send users SMS messages when they complete a recipe
- [Trigger recipes anonymously](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/anonymous-recipes/); fire automations without users needing to sign in. This also means you can turn any form (including forms from free form plugins like Ninja Forms, Contact Form 7, WP Forms, Formidable Forms and more) into registration forms that not only create a new user, but also set them up with course access, group access and more
- Have 2 WordPress sites talk to each other. [Sell products on one site](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/send-data-to-a-webhook/) while [Uncanny Automator creates users](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/webhook-triggers/) and sets up access on another!
- Have external apps [trigger recipes](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/webhook-triggers/) and vice versa (without needing Zapier or Integromat!)
- Set up [buttons](https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/magic-button/) that can trigger any recipe on click
- Set custom usermeta

An [Automator Pro](https://automatorplugin.com/pricing/) license also includes access to our world-class premium support.
