Uncanny Automator is the easiest and most powerful way to connect your WordPress plugins, sites and apps together with powerful automations. Build automated workflows in minutes with no code!

## Description

Uncanny Automator is the easiest and most powerful way to automate your WordPress site with no code. Build automations in minutes that connect your WordPress plugins, sites and apps together using billions of recipe combinations.

Here's how Uncanny Automator works:

When something happens, Automator can make other things happen.

When a user buys a product, add them to a membership level, enroll them in a course and pass their information to Google Sheets.

It's that simple! Here's a video outlining how it all works.

If you've used Zapier, setting things up will be intuitive. And if not, that's okay too!

### E-commerce Automation

Improve customer engagement by having your purchases trigger marketing automation campaigns, award store credit, promote 5-star reviews, schedule time-limited bonus offers and offer profile-driven discounts. Or for advanced reporting and customer service, create WooCommerce automations that send purchase details to Google Sheets, Slack and ActiveCampaign. It’s all automatic and you can build these recipes in minutes!

### Google Sheets Automation

Build powerful reports and dashboards based on almost any WordPress activity or data with 1-click Google Sheets integration. Track purchases, course completions, blog post updates, forum posts and more. Not only can you create new rows for reports with Uncanny Automator, but you can update existing records, making it perfect for dashboard reporting.

### Webhook Automation

Looking for the most powerful and comprehensive webhook support to connect your WordPress site to other apps? Uncanny Automator has support for security headers, any request method and any data format (including nesting support, JSON, XML, arrays and more). Use our 1-click sample generation and debug records to simplify connecting to other sites and systems, and send unlimited outgoing webhooks with the free version.

### LearnDash and E-Learning Automation

Personalize student experiences and deliver better learning outcomes with no-code automations. Notify an instructor when users fail a quiz and enroll them in a remedial course–automatically. Add users to groups based on performance to allow easy collaboration. Automate student outreach when users fall behind in their coursework and offer easy learning interventions.

### Social Media Automation

Spend less time sharing your posts and announcements on social media with automatic posting. Automatically post anything you want to Facebook Pages, Facebook Groups, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram, including with images and links. Sign up for a free account to get 250 credits for social posting; Pro plugin users get unlimited posting.

### BuddyBoss Automation

Put your social community on autopilot with simple Automator recipes that promote sharing and collaboration. Sync groups with membership levels, share key accomplishments in your activity feeds, move users between groups as they progress in LearnDash courses.

### Take automation to the next level

[Uncanny Automator Pro](https://automatorplugin.com/pricing/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=take_automation_next_level), our premium plugin, adds even more features and integrations, including the ability to create users and posts, delay and schedule actions, connect multiple sites together, add conditions to actions, and unlock unlimited use of app integrations integrations like Google Sheets and Twitter. It also triples the number of available triggers and actions.

Here are some of the other really cool automations you can create with [Automator Pro](https://automatorplugin.com/pricing/?utm_source=wp_repo_automator&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=create_really_cool_automations):

- When a user makes a purchase using WooCommerce on one site, create a user on another WP site, send the user a link to set a new password, enroll the user in a course and add a membership level.
- When a user submits a form, add the user to a mailing list if their email address matches a certain domain, add them to a social group and schedule their trial access to expire in 7 days if they don't make a purchase.
